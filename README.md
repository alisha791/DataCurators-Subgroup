###Group SMART Goal

* Clean up the SCEC data from 1938-2013: remove NA's, create datetime column
* Read Luen article to determine magnitude type needed for analysis
* 
* Specific-Yes-We know which tasks we are working on.  We are working on making the data into a form usable by the analyzers and visualizers.  We are also providing information on the format of the output so that groups further along can progress with their work even without the exact data.
* Measurable-Yes-We will be able to determine our progress.  Our end output shows clearly whether or not we have accomplished cleaning NA's and creating a datetime column.  
* Attainable-Yes-We are choosing goals we can reach by Tuesday
* Relevant-Yes-Everything we are working on is necessary for the analyzers; we have communicated with their group to see what is most relevant and important for them.  The tasks that we do should make it easier for them to analyze the data.  
* Time-bound-Yes-We are making progress and are on track to finish
